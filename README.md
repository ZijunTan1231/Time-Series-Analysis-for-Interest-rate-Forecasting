• Time Series Modeling: Developed various time series models including SARIMA, Prophet, and statistical models to analyze trends and seasonality.

• Generated derivative features by leveraging techniques such as lagged variables and rolling means to capture nuanced patterns in the time series data. Utilized MinMaxScaler to normalize feature data and TimeseriesGenerator for structured data.

• Deep Learning: Implemented LSTM, GRU and Transformer on the processed dataset. Optimized the hyperparameters (number of layers, optimization methods) via grid search.
